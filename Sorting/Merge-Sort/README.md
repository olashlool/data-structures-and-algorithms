# Insertion Sort

## Challenge Summary

Merge Sort splits an array into half sized sub-arrays until they are pair values. 
It then sorts and swaps pairs values if needed. The sorting process continues on all of the sub-arrays, 
combining the smaller arrays until the full list is merged.

## Approach & Efficiency


- Time: O(n log n)

    It is reducing the size of the array in half each time it has to work with it, thus reducing the amount of work to complete each iteration.

- Space: O(n)

    A merge sort does not sort in place and requires additional storage space for the elements.
