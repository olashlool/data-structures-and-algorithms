# Singly Linked List

A linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations.
A linked list consists of nodes where each node contains a data field and a reference to the next node in the list.

## Challenge
- Create a linked list and node class 
- Create methods to 
  - Insert 
  - Includes 
  - ToString

## Approach & Efficiency
##### Includes
- Big O Time = O(n)
- Big O Space = O(n)

##### Insert
- Big O Time = O(1) 
- Big O Space = O(n)


## API
- Insert method :

> Arguments: data Adds a new node with value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.

- Includes method :

> Arguments: data search in the linked List with an o(n) Time performance. 

- ToString method:

> its a method to print the collecation for all the element inside the linked list.
